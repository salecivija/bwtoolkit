 Toolkit for ModManager

This code creates a GUI window with checkboxes for each zip file in the zip_files list. The user can select which files to download by checking the corresponding checkboxes. There is also a button to select the destination folder path, and a label to display the selected path. Finally, there is a download button that will download the selected zip files to the specified destination folder.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
